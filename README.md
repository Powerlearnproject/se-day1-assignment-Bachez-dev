SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 
Software engineering -a computer science field that involves the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications.
Importance – Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life e.g. communication

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
   
Development of programming languages
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline
Rise of agile methodologies 

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   
Requirements – gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
Design- creating high level and detailed designs of software architecture and user     interface.
Implementation – Writing code and building the software according to design specifications.
Testing – Carrying out tests to ensure the software meets the required standards.
Deployment – Releasing the software to customers and clients.
Maintenance – providing ongoing support and updates after deployment.


4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
   
Agile methodologies bring about Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility collaboration and responding to change while Waterfall Sequential approach with distinct phases e.g. requirements and design flowing downwards like a waterfall.

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
   
Software engineer: responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality assurance engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing the plans.
Project manager: Oversees planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
   
IDEs – provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code (Vs code).
VCS – responsible for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among the team members.

7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
   
Problems: Changing equipment’s, Tight deadlines, Technical debt 
Solutions: agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, regular reassessment of timelines.

8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
   
Unit testing – Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration testing – Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
Systems testing – Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing - Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering 

1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
   
Prompt engineering – is the process of designing and optimizing natural language instructions to guide AI models to generate the desired output.
Importance: helps users get relevant results, improves user AI interactions and helps mitigate bias.

2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
   
“Write an email to your boss about the project” – can you help me write an essay to my boss about the project.
The improved prompt becomes more effective since it is a request and not more giving an assignment.
